# AutoPurge discord channel

made with extensibility in mind, tho it only have 1 purpose.

## Usage
1. will provide a docker-compose file, if i remember to make one. (i won't test it either lol)
2. invite the bot to your server of choice
3. do `/autoPurge` on a channel and it will purge every 2 weeks (14 days). This bot is made for a specific server, might add custom range later.
